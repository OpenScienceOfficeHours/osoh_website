### Expert of the month
<orange>Cecilia Herbert<br> Training, Support, Outreach Scientific Team Lead  at the
Open Ephys Production Site, Lisbon, Portugal</orange>

Cecilia is a neuroscientist dedicated to disseminating open source technology. She leads the Training, Support and Outreach Scientific Team at Open Ephys, a company that develops, produces and distributes open-source tools for neuroscience. Since getting involved in this field in 2020, she has participated in numerous workshops, outreach events, and advanced training courses, and has organized the Electrophysiology Acquisition NeuroKit Course. Her talks and course modules highlight open source hardware and software for electrophysiology, neuronal imaging, and behavioral acquisition and control in freely moving animals. Acting as a link between developers and users, Cecilia strives to demystify technical concepts and listen to community needs to contribute back to open-source projects. She focuses on spreading knowledge inclusively and accessibly—particularly to new users and across language barriers—through hands-on, interactive activities, in the hope of empowering researchers with the flexibility and independence to tackle their scientific questions.

<orange>Abstract</orange>
At Open Ephys we develop, produce and distribute ready-to-use open-source tools for neuroscience. In this talk, I will cover the acquisition system options we have for miniscopes, the Miniscope DAQ and ONIX, highlighting our work adapting the original UCLA Miniscope design for production. I will present our developments for the ecosystem such as our torque-free commutator, how we provide Technical Support and Repairs, and what Training options are available. I'll demo acquisition in the Miniscope-DAQ-qt software and Bonsai. I hope to engage in discussions with experienced and new users to continue to improve the technology and resources available.
