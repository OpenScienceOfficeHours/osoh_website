### Description
Open Data adheres to the **[F.A.I.R principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)**, which ensure that data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. These principles make data easy to find, access, and use across different systems, and for different purposes. The application of the F.A.I.R principles increases transparency, promotes collaboration, and drives innovation in scientific research by making data from diverse sources readily usable. This not only supports reproducibility and accelerates discoveries, but also upholds the core values of open science: openness, integrity, and accessibility.

Even though not all data can be shared publicly due to ethical and privacy concerns, improving the F.A.I.R compliance of a dataset can significantly improve its internal usability â€“  making it easier to integrate with other data, reducing the risks of loss, and increasing its reuse within your team or lab.


### Requirements
To earn the Open Data badge, participants must fulfill at least ONE of the following requirements:

#### 1. Share a dataset following best practices
* Publish a dataset that supports the results containted in a research publication or preprint on a suitable data repository, AND
* Adhere to F.A.I.R Principles: Ensure the dataset has a persistent identifier, is accompanied by descriptive metadata, and is organized as per community standards, AND
* Cite Your Dataset: Link the dataset in your published paper or preprint and cite it properly including the persistent identigier to ensure traceability and recognition.

* Provide Evidence: Provide links or screenshots to showcase your involvement.
  
_Note: For data involving human participants, ensure you have the necessary consents, approvals, and that the data sharing complies with these permissions._

#### 2. Improve the F.A.I.R.ness of one or more datasets within your lab
Multiple things can be done to Improve the F.A.I.R.ness of datasets without sharing openly on an online data repository, for instance:

* Use Data Management Tools: Implement tools like datalad for versioning and tracking data provenance, OR
* Standardize Data Organization: Reorganize datasets according to community standards (e.g., BIDS, NWB) to facilitate future reuse, OR
* Enhance Metadata: Add detailed, structured metadata using standardized vocabularies to make the data more understandable and usable, OR
* Convert Data Formats: Change proprietary data files into open formats, making them freely accessible for future use.

* Provide Evidence: Provide links or screenshots to showcase your involvement.
  
_Pro Tip: If you develop code to organize, convert, or describe your data, share this code openly to further progress toward earning the Open Data Badge!_
