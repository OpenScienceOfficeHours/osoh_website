### About Open Methods
Methods written in traditional research articles often provide an overview of the experimental procedures, but are often not detailed enough to allow for full reproducibility. Moreover, publishing analysis methods and hypotheses only at the final publication stage, that is, after results are known, can lead to biases in analytical choices and other suboptimal research practices, contributing to the reproducibility crisis.

Open research methods are crucial for transparency, reproducibility, collaboration and accessibility. Open Methods encompass a series of practices that aim to make research protocols more easily shareable, reusable and reproducible.

### Requirements
