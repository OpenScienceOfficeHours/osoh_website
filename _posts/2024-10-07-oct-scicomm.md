Hilary is a PhD candidate at the Montreal Neurological Institute under the supervision of Dr. Xiaoqian Chai. Her research uses fMRI to study the development of memory in autism spectrum disorder as it relates to social communication. Hilary has been actively involved in SciComm in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience since joining McGill in 2019. She first volunteered for BrainReach and later cofounded and now leads two initiatives, Brain Info Cerveau and NeuroLingo, aimed at providing trainees with practical SciComm training and experience. Additionally, Hilary works at the Office of Science Education teaching undergraduate students about the neuroscience of learning to empower them with science-backed study strategies.

<orange>Abstract</orange>
Science has historically been regarded as a field for experts, offering limited opportunities for non-scientists to engage or participate. In an age of rampant misinformation, building trust and providing access to reliable information is more critical than ever. In the spirit of open science, scientists have a responsibility to break down barriers to accessing scientific findings, products, and the research process itself. This workshop will explore the ethics of science communication and its role in the open science movement. Together, we will also discuss practical methods for communicating science effectively, and participants will begin developing engaging, accessible pieces based on their own research.
