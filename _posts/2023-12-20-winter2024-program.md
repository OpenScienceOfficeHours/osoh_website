subtitle: From January to May, we're all about Open Code and Software for Analysis!
---

The first half of 2024 will be centered on **OPEN Code & Analysis**. Every month we'll cover a theme touching best practices for data analysis involving open code and software for data visualization, analysis and statistics. As usual, we have a line up of handpicked experts on deck to lead workshops and offer one-on-one help.

More details about the thematic months, experts and events are released in separate posts as each month approaches.

### January 2024
**Getting started and setting up common tools related to Open Analysis & Code.**

We are starting the year without a monthly theme or workshop. Instead, we'll have a small get together every week to help get started with the most useful software and tools, such as **Git/Github, R and Python**. Installing and getting ready to work with these software can take some time and be frustrating if you have never done it. We are here to help! Making sure you have these tools installed and ready to go will make things smoother for the following Months workshops.

Come find us at walk-in office hours, each Tuesday at 3pm in BT100 at The Neuro. The weekly tool will be adertised here and through our Twitter account.

### February 2024
**Git & Github for everyone!**

Code management, Collaboration and Sharing (2h lecture and workshop). No prior Git/Github knowledge needed.

### March 2024
**Improve your coding game: Reproducible, Reusable and Trustable code.**

Nearly all researhers and trainees write some code to analyse data, but how many of us are actually confident in our code? Do we know how to make sure it is error free, robust, and re-usable by others? This month we're introducing you to the basics of good coding practices.

### April 2024
**Open Source tools for Data Visualization and Statistics**

Many of us are using proprietary tools to vizualize and analyze data, because they are convenient and that's the best we know. However, using proprietary tools is not great for enabling others to re-use and reproduce our work. In April we will cover Open Source alternatives for data vizualization and analysis.

### May 2024
**Open Tools and Worksflows for Wet Labs**
In May, we will cover great open source tools to vizualiza and analyze data, particularly in the context of "wet" labs (e.g., microscopy, genetics, immunology).
