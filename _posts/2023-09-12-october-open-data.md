### About
After the September introduction to Data Management and Sharing, October is the month to really get our hands dirt and start using data standards to organize neuroscience data and realize how useful this is for our own in-lab efficiency, and for sharing trully re-usable data.

We have recruited a wonderful expert on the Braim Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) to offer a **seminar** at the start of the month, and whom will be available throughout October for **one-on-one consultations** and help you get started with this standard. BIDS is an fabulous example of a successuful community-driven data standard, and is applicable to a wide range of neuroscience data (NOT JUST MRI!).

### Expert of the month
<orange>Remi Gau, Phd<br>Research Associate, McGill University</orange>

Remi is a cognitive neuroscientist interested in multisensory perception, high-resolution fMRI as well as open and reproducible science. He is part of the BIDS Maintainers group, among many other things.

<orange>Abstract</orange>
The brain imaging data structure (BIDS) is fast becoming the main standard to organize neuroimaging data. Having your data in BIDS offers many downstream advantages to users: use of standardized pipelines, facilitate data sharing and reuseâ€¦ But getting your data to be BIDS compliant can also be source of much frustration. Especially when it is the first time you are dealing with neuroimaging data. 

This talk aims to reduce that frustration by:
* Giving a quick overview of the data management principles that underpin BIDS. Remembering and following a rule is always easier when you understand why the rule was put in place: so I will spend a bit of time explaining the reason why BIDS is structured the way it is. 
* Giving pointers and tips to convert and validate your datasets. Using automated BIDS converters is recommended, but It can be hard to know which one to use. I will try to give pointers to help you choose and get started.
