<orange>Abstract</orange>

In this months' open science hours, she will introduce DataLad and its features for open and reproducible science. A workshop-like introductory lecture will give participants the chance to try out the tool with interactive hands-on examples, and introduce core concepts for open science, such as version control, digital provenance, containerization, or data publication. The workshop focuses on technical and conceptual aspects alike, and aims to equip the participants with skills they could transfer to the real-world data collected during their research.
