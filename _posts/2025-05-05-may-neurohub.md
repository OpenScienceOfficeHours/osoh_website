<orange>Abstract</orange>
NeuroHub is a research platform and software services ecosystem designed to support neuroscience and health research. Built on the foundations of LORIS and CBRAIN, NeuroHub enables secure access to multi-modal data and computational tools across institutions and a distributed network of connected resources. It promotes transparency and reproducibility by allowing researchers to discover, manage, share, and analyze data within a trusted research environment. NeuroHub aligns with FAIR principles and integrates data management planning, version control, and reproducible workflows. This presentation will explore how NeuroHub empowers the research community to conduct scalable and collaborative open science.
