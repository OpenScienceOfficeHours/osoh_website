      <p class="lead mb-2 text-left">Not sure if your questions are within the scope of OSOH? We are happy to talk 
        about anything open science! Here are some examples:</p>
      </p>
      <p class="lead mb-2 text-left">You are an undergraduate student, who constantly runs into paywalls when trying 
        to read papers that spark your interest. You would like to know more about McGill's efforts to enable open 
        publishing.</p>
      </p>
      <p class="lead mb-2 text-left">You are a new graduate student and are just getting started on your research project. 
        You would like to collaborate with other lab members on analyzing your data, but would like to be able to 
        track, adjust and potentially reverse their changes to the code.</p>
      </p>
      <p class="lead mb-2 text-left">You are a new PI and are incredulous about the amount of costs involved
        in the tools and software used for your research. You would like to learn more about open science alternatives 
        to be more cost-efficient.</p>
      </p>
      <p class="lead mb-2 text-left">You are established in your field of research and have been managing your own lab for
        a long time now. However, you are unsatisfied with how your research is being disseminated and would like to make 
        your findings more reproducible and accessible to others.</p>
