## What is Open Science Office Hours?
OSOH is ...
- Focus on Neuroscience (but some domain-general)
- Focus on trainees, but not exclusively (by and for trainees)

OSOH is supported by the Tanenbaum Open Science Institute (TOSI) and The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital).

### Curated Resources
Open Science is booming, and so is the amount of resources, tools and documentation around Open Science practices.
I can be difficult to make sense of it all and find what fits your needs when browsing online. Our Resources page 
contains a wide and ever-growing array of hand-picked resources to learn about and implement Open Science practices. 
Importantly, these resources are hand-picked by our team, categorized and searchable through several filters for you to 
rapidly find the information you need based on your area of research or what Open Science practice you need help with.

While most resources found on this page are relevant to the Neurosciences, several topics of Open Science are domain-agnostic and so are the associated resources.
