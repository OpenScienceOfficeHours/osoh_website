Have an idea for a theme? Want to suggest a missing Open Science resource?
We strive to make OSOH as dynamic and useful as possible to the Neuroscience community, and we would love to have your input. 

## Community Feedback Wanted: Website beta testing July-August 2023
Open Science Office Hours is almost ready to launch and we are requesting feedback from the community about the OSOH website to make it better, more intuitive, more useful.
We would appreciate any comments about the website in general, but would more specifically appreciate inputs about the Open Science **[Resources page](../open_science_resources)**:
* Are the filters intuitive?
* Any filters that you think are missing or irrelevant?
* Any bugs or navigation issues?

Note: The website is not currently optimized for Mobile and we are working on this (all features should work, but there are visual display issues). For now please use on laptop/desktop for testing and feedback.

Your feedback is most welcome! Please add to this Github issue **[Thread for Beta Website Testing](https://github.com/OpenScienceOfficeHours/osoh_website/issues/22)** or email us using our **[contact page](../contact)**.


## Suggest Resources
If you have ideas for what to add to our **[resources page](../open_science_resources)**, please let us know:
* by opening an Issue on the website's **[Github repository](https://github.com/OpenScienceOfficeHours/osoh_website)**, making sure to select the "resource suggestion" label,
* or if you are not so familiar with Github, by writting us an email using our **[contact page](../contact)**.

## Tutorials / lectures / Experts 
If you're interested in leading a tutorial, giving a lecture, or be the OSOH expert for a monthly theme, please email us using our **[contact page](../contact)**.

## Suggest Themes
If you have suggestions for a theme that we should cover (e.g., registered reports, open software, etc.), please email us using our **[contact page](../contact)**. We will periodically ask the community to vote on suggested themes via our social media account(s).

## Please read our **[code of conduct]()**
