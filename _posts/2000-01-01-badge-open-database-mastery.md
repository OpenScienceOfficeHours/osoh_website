### About Open Databases and Re-using Open Data
The Open Database Mastery badge is designed to celebrate the skills and expertise of fellow neuroscientists in effectively re-using open data and navigating databases. It implies a deep understanding and proficiency in harnessing the capabilities, insights, and potential offered by open databases. In a broader context, this badge will help trainees become adept at using open databases for various purposes such as research, analysis, or application development. It will also help trainees align with the TOSIâ€™s vision to maximize the use of open data to solve problems in neuroscience.

### Requirements
To earn the Open Database Mastery badge, participants must fulfill requirements for at least one of the following options:

#### Option 1: Incorporate Open Data in your Research
1. **Use of Open Data:** Use data from open neuroscience databases (e.g., NCBI, Allen Brain Research Institute, CBIG, Ontario Brain Institute, UK Biobank, etc.) in your research reported in a preprint or peer-reviewed article.

#### Option 2: Augment the potential of Open Databases and the Open Data Ecosystem
1. **Build software tools to:** query, scrape, annotate or harmonize data across multiple open databases, or
2. Tools that integrate machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling using big open data.

### Submission Checklist
All submissions go through the [Open Science Bagdges Submission Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=cZYxzedSaEqvqfz4-J8J6ut_5ADJQNBIjT-33hrU9ERUM1dWQzU4UjNBWENZVUoxUUMzNVZINU9GRC4u). Here is what to include in your applicaiton file depending on which Option described above you are following:

#### For Incorporating Open Data in your Research (Option 1):
* Provide a link and persistent identifier to the preprint or peer-reviewed article reporting results obtained by re-using data from an open database.
* Include a brief description (max. 250 words) of the open data used in your research, and of the research project itself.

#### Augmenting the potential of Open Databases and the Open Data Ecosystem (Option 2):
* Provide link(s) and persistent identifier(s) to publication, preprint, code-repository, etc. where the tools reside.
* Include a brief description (max. 250 words) of the tools developed, and how they are enabling to better leverage Open Databases.
