### Expert of the month
<orange>Cecilia Rocha<br>Early Drug Discovery Unit, The Neuro, McGill University</orange>

Cecilia Rocha is a Senior Research Associate with experience in brain development. Cecilia has a masterâ€™s in Molecular Biology by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and obtained her PhD in Cellular Biology working on cytoskeletal alterations at the Institute Curie, France. After her postdoc working on neuronal cytoskeleton and development, Cecilia started working at the Neuro EDDU where she has been for the past 6 years developing iPSC-derived 2D and 3D neuronal models to study the molecular basis of neurological diseases and testing targets to help identify potential therapies.

<orange>Abstract</orange>
The Early Drug Discovery Unit (EDDU) mission is to accelerate the development of new therapies for patients living with brain disorders. The EDDU is an active participant in fostering and practising open science, and we train researchers to work with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by offering trainings and workshops to the scientific community, as well as providing our written and video protocols that are freely available at the EDDU website. In this section I will share my experience developing the protocols and video materials showing how our team used the appropriate tools to create our virtual and interactive iPSC training.

<orange>Attendance is FREE, please register:</orange>
