### About
In this first thematic month of the Fall 2023 semester of Open Data, we thought it would be good to start by covering the foundation of Open Data: Introduction to best practices in research data management and data sharing.

Good data management is the cornerstone of Open and Reproducible Science. First, well-organized and documented data makes it so much easier for you and others to work on your data (do you think you could quickly do additional analyses that reviewers ask for, several months after submitting a publication? Do you think a future trainee in the lab could make sense of your data five years after you are gone?). Secondly, there is no point in sharing messy data that no one ca make sense of or re-use, making good data management and the F.A.I.R principles (you don't know what this is? great, read-on!) crucial for data sharing and Open Science.

To help us with all of this complicated stuff, we have recruited a wonderful expert on that topic to offer a **seminar** at the start of the month, and whom will be available throughout September to book **one-on-one Zoom consultations** with you.

### Expert of the month
<orange>Alisa Rod, Phd<br>Research Data Management Specialist at McGill University Library</orange>

Alisa has extensive experience in providing individual consulting to campus researchers and research groups on the fundamentals of research data management issues, including data management planning, funding agency requirements, data citation practices, open data, and research data lifecycle management. Alisa also helps researchers sharing data with McGill's insitutional research data repository (Dataverse).
