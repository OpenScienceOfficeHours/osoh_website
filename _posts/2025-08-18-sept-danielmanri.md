<orange>Abstract</orange>
In the age of data-intensive neurobiology, imaging technologies produce enormous amounts of complex data. However, these images are often poorly documented, inconsistently analyzed, and inaccessible to others. This presentation invites researchers to consider a fundamental question: What is required to make bioimaging data truly reusable and reproducible? Through the lens of current challenges and emerging solutions, we explore how thoughtful metadata practices, standardized formats, and open-source tools can transform isolated image files into rich, shareable research objects. We delve into community-driven guidelines and practical tools, such as the MicroMeta app and OMERO, that help researchers capture essential experimental context. We highlight how reproducible raw data and analysis workflows promote transparency. Data sharing is not merely a compliance exercise; it is a professional and ethical commitment to the scientific community.
