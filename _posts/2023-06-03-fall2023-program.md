Fall 2023 is the **season of OPEN DATA**! Join us for an exciting series of events exploring
best practices for data management, data sharing and re-using of open datasets.

### September 2023
**Intro to good Data Management practices and Data Sharing**
Get to know how to make your lives easier with good data management. We will introduce you to the FAIR principles 
and to Open Data Sharing with the McGill Dataverse. Our expert for the month is Alisa Rod, Research Data Management 
Secialist at McGill Library.

### October 2023
**Data Standards: The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) - not just for MRI data!**
Learn how you can get started with using data standards to organize your work. We will discuss the advantages of BIDS 
for Data management and Sharing, how to get started with BIDS, and how to participate in the BIDS community to expand 
it for more data types. 

### November 2023
**Big Data: How to find, access and (re-)use Open Datasets**
Large open datasets are increasingly available and could complement your work to make it more impactful, or avoid 
data collection all together. Learn important tips and tricks to find, access, and use existing open data 
(e.g., UK BioBank).

### December 2023
**Dataset tracking and version control with Datalad**
Become fluent in Datalad, a tool that enables you to track and version control your datasets as they grow 
and evolve, making it easier to collaborate with others. Datalad is further increasingly used to get access to open 
datasets on the web.
