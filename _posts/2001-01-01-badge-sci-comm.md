### About Science Communication
Science communication is essential for translating complex scientific concepts into accessible and engaging narratives that reach diverse audiences. By effectively communicating their research findings, scientists can increase public understanding of science, inspire interest in STEM fields, help fight misinformation, and promote informed decision-making about important social issues. Through clear and engaging communication, scientists bridge the gap between the scientific community and the general public, promoting dialogue, trust, and collaboration to address shared challenges and advance scientific knowledge for the benefit of society.

### Requirements

#### Option 1: Present Your Work in Science Communication and/or Outreach Events
Present your work in at least two science outreach events (e.g., public presentations, 3-Minute Thesis Competition, Neurolingo, BrainReach, NeuroInfo, etc.).

#### Option 2: Create Media Content Related to Science Communication
1. **Contribute to a Social Media Account or Media Outlet:** Lead or participate in the organization of a social media account, other web outlet, or media outlet to share and communicate science with meaningful engagement. OR
2. **Create Science Communication Pieces:** Create at least two science communication pieces aiming to make science accessible to a wide audience (e.g., blog posts, articles in news outlets & magazines).

#### Option 3: Create, Lead, or Organize a Science Communication Initiative
Lead or participate in the organization/coordination of a science outreach initiative (e.g., BrainReach, Neurolingo, Curious Neuron, etc.).

#### Option 4: Take a Science Communication Course or Training
Complete a course, program, or summer school relevant to Science Communication (e.g., McGill Writing Centre’s “Communicating Science to the Public” Course WCOM 614).
