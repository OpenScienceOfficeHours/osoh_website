### About Open Code
Implementing open code in scientific practices is crucial as it enables you to directly engage with computational methods, fostering hands-on learning experiences and skill development in programming and data analysis. 

Additionally, open code promotes transparency and reproducibility in research. This means others can have a look at your code, reproduce your results more readily,  understand how conclusions were drawn, and trust the science behind them. This process demystifies complex methodologies and promotes a learning environment where knowledge is open to everyone.

Moreover, open code encourages you to work together with others in the scientific community. It's about collaboration and innovation, providing you with opportunities to contribute to research projects and share your own discoveries effectively.

### Requirements
To earn the Open Code badge, participants must fulfill criteria for at least one of the following options:

#### Option 1: Create and Share Open Source Code
1. **Develop Open Source Code:** Create open-source scripts, software, or package.
2. **Publish on a Platform:** Publish the code a platform like GitHub or GitLab. Ensure it is under an open-source license recognized by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses).
3. **Document Your Code:** Include a README file at the root of the repository. Add docstrings and clear instructions for user-friendliness and reusability.

#### Option 2: Contribute Meaningfully to Existing Open Source Projects
1. **Make Meaningful Contributions:** Either multiple small contributions (e.g., multiple pull requests for small changes/additions) or one considerable contribution (e.g., a substantial pull request to fix a bug or add a feature). A contribution can be in the form of code, or adding documentation that improves the readability, reusability, and accessibility of existing code.
2. **Ensure Accessibility:** The code you are contributing tomust be on an accessible online platform (e.g., GitHub) and released under an open-source license recognized by the Open Source Initiative.

#### Option 3: Participate in Open Source Discussions
1. **Engage in Community Forums or Issue Trackers:** Participate actively in forums or issue trackers (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub, Stack Exchange, Neurostars, Biostars, image.sc). Review code on GitHub and partake in discussions to improve project quality.

### Submission Checklist
All submissions go through the [Open Science Bagdges Submission Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=cZYxzedSaEqvqfz4-J8J6ut_5ADJQNBIjT-33hrU9ERUM1dWQzU4UjNBWENZVUoxUUMzNVZINU9GRC4u).
