* by opening an Issue on the website's **[Github repository](https://github.com/OpenScienceOfficeHours/osoh_website)**, making sure to select the "resource suggestion" label,
* or if you are not so familiar with Github, by writting us an email using our **[contact page](../contact)**.

## Tutorials / lectures / Experts
