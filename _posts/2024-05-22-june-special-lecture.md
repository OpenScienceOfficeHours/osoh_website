<orange>Abstract</orange>
Creating open science papers and other research objects is a multifaceted endeavor that can vary considerably between fields and projects. TOSI and other organization have worked hard to build consensus on what exactly the principles of open science are. In this workshop we will survey existing and emerging bibliometric tools that allow scientists to evaluate their published works (as well as manuscripts still in preparation) for adherence to different rubrics of open science practices. We'll also discuss the dangers of "Open Science Shaming" and how best to promote open science practices in fields and labs that have been slower to embrace them.
